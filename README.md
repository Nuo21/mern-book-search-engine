<Week 21 - MERN Book Search Engine>

## Description

This application allows users to search for books through the book API from Google. Users can also signup and create their own accounts. If they do so, they are then able to save books that they like to their Saved Books section and can refer back whenever needed. Users can also delete and remove the books from their list as well.
